# IDL-mvn-dep
The purpose of this repo is to offer the Inter-parameter Dependency Language (IDL) as a Maven project, which can be compiled as a JAR or included as a Maven dependency into other projects.

You can use this library in your project by including it as a POM dependency, as follows:

```xml
<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/es.us.isa/idl -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>es.us.isa</groupId>
    <artifactId>idl</artifactId>
    <version>0.0.1</version>
</dependency>

```
